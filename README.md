# optimizing-code
Exercises provided to practice optimizing code. You can use the links provided in each problem file to use an online platform to complete this problem. 

The two js files in this repo contain *non-optimal* solutions for these questions. In each of these problems, there is a better data structure that you could use to achieve an improvement in time complexity. Take a stab at it here -- or copy these into leetcode/codewars and work there.

1. Remove duplicate words (currently a O(n^2) solution) (Codewars)
2. Two-Sum (currently a O(n^2) solution) (Leetcode)
